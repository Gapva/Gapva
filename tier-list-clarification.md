the tier lists are structured based on my enjoyment and how much i agree with the philosophy of the language/tool/whatever.
the languages are NOT ranked based on just one thing. there is no rhyme to each ranking, **but there is a reason**.

for example, GDScript is placed so highly despite being interpreted because it aims to be a very clean and usable resource for new programmers,
and i think it near-flawlessly meets that criteria. in my opinion, there is no better beginner language than GDScript, especially within the field of game development or GUI.
this ranking takes many things into account. despite it succeeding so well at what it does,
i placed it lower than the highest tier because it has some shortcomings that make it a suboptimal choice for usage by experts
(e.g. no nested dictionary strongtype support, no 64 vs 32 bit support for numerical types, various complex data structures absent, etc.)

as for the tier list of "various other things", it should be more self-explanatory because i'm not ranking things of the same type anymore.
for example, i put React and Electron so low because i heavily despise native web frameworks.
i also put Windows, macOS, and iOS on the same tier. is it because they are web-related? no, it's simply because i dislike them as operating systems.
there's nothing more to it.

hopefully this clears up some misconceptions
